Fang Timer
-----
This is a reimplementation of [Fang'o Timer](https://github.com/GearFox98/fango), the one I made in Python + Flet, it worked pretty well but since
Flet had a dependency I wasn't really using, I decided to remake it using Qt and C++

Fang is a pomodoro app, it will count the time for you and give you a notification when the time is up, according with the phase you're in!
I hope Fang helps you to manage your time as much as it does for me.
